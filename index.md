The proposed project brings together three leading research groups from different disciplines to work on an inherently interdisciplinary problem: creating a state-of-the-art network of sensors emplaced within an extreme environment at the heavily-crevassed tidewater margin of a glacier. Swansea Glaciology Group has considerable research expertise in various components of the cryosphere, specialising in geophysical techniques, remote sensing and modelling.

The team within the Institute of Advanced Telecommunications (IAT) at Swansea provide expertise in wireless networking, and the group at the School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Newcastle University in the required sensor technology and data processing. Our combined experience will provide the complete skill base and field expertise to provide field data to help solve a key question in glaciology â€” that of understanding the relationship between glacier calving and glacier dynamics on a tidewater glacier, and will furthermore provide a demonstration network of sensors in an extreme environment.
